# STEGANOGRAPHY
This project focuses on **steganography**, a technique used to embed secret messages within images without altering their visual quality. Unlike traditional encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography conceals its very existence, making it a powerful tool for secure communication.  


# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **steganography**, a technique for securely embedding secret messages into images without noticeable alterations. Unlike traditional encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography ensures that the existence of hidden data remains undetectable.  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
- Conventional encryption methods can raise suspicion due to the presence of encrypted data.  
- There is a need for a secure way to hide confidential information within digital images.  
- This project enables **lossless data hiding** while maintaining the integrity of the cover image.  
- It also provides a **user-friendly GUI**, allowing both technical and non-technical users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Security Measures:** Basic encryption for password-protected data hiding  
- **Platform:** Windows 11  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Invisible Data Embedding:** Secret messages are embedded within an image without altering its visual quality.  
✅ **Lossless Data Hiding:** The original image retains its quality while securely storing the hidden message.  
✅ **Multi-Format Support:** Works with various image formats (PNG recommended for best results).  

## 🎯 End Users  
- **Cybersecurity Professionals:** Exploring advanced secure communication techniques.  
- **Government & Defense Agencies:** Securely exchanging classified information.  
- **Journalists & Activists:** Protecting sensitive data from surveillance.  
- **Software Developers & Researchers:** Learning and implementing steganography concepts.
